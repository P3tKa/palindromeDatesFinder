# palindromeDatesFinder

This GitHub repository serves as my submission for the SourceryAcademy for developers admission special task. The goal of this project is to find and print palindrome dates within a specified date range.

## What are Palindrome Dates?

Palindrome dates are special dates that read the same forwards and backwards. For example, "2010-01-02" is a palindrome date because it reads the same whether you start from the beginning or the end.

### Usage

To find **palindrome dates** within a specified date range, follow these simple steps:

1. Import the **BonusDates** class into your Java project. This class contains the necessary methods for finding and printing palindrome dates.
1. Invoke the **printBonusDatesBetween(fromYear, toYear)** method to discover palindrome dates within a specified date range.

- **fromYear:** The starting year for your date range.
- **toYear:** The ending year for your date range.
